# Create A New Price

	Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for
	both recurring and one-time purchases of products. Products help you
	track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms.
	Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by
	products, and pricing options should be represented by prices.
	This approach lets you change prices without having to change your
	provisioning scheme. For example, you might have a single "gold"
	product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once.
