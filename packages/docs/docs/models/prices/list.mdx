# Listing Prices

You can list prices using the `get` method of the `\CheckoutEngine\Models\Price` model.
By default, it will list the latest 20 prices (both active and inactive) that were created.

## Examples

### Get the latest prices

You can get the latest 20 prices by using the get method:
```php
\CheckoutEngine\Models\Price::get();
```

### Get the latest x number of prices
You can also specify your query using the api query variables along with the `where` method.

```php
\CheckoutEngine\Models\Price::where([
	'limit' => 30
])->get();
```

### Get only active prices

```php
\CheckoutEngine\Models\Price::where([
	'active' => true
])->get();
```

### Get all inactive prices

```php
\CheckoutEngine\Models\Price::where([
	'active' => false
])->get();
```

### Get prices using a list of price ids.

```php
\CheckoutEngine\Models\Price::where([
	'ids' => [
		'85109619-529d-47b3-98c3-ca90d22913e4',
		'dd514523-297b-4a86-b5ff-6db0a70d7e17'
	]
])->get();
```

## Where Parameters

import Attribute from '../../../components/Attribute';

### limit <Attribute>INTEGER</Attribute>
A limit on the number of objects to be returned, between 1 and 100.
Minimum value is 0, maximum value is 100. Default value is 20.

### starting_after <Attribute>STRING</Attribute>
A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `"starting_after" => "obj_foo"` in order to fetch the next page of the list.

### ending_before <Attribute>STRING</Attribute>
A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_bar, your subsequent call can include `"ending_before" => "obj_bar"` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

### active <Attribute>BOOLEAN</Attribute>
Only return objects that are active or inactive (e.g., pass false to list all inactive objects).

### ids[] <Attribute>ARRAY[]</Attribute>
Only return objects with the given IDs.

The `where` method supports parameters allowed by the API, which can be seen here:
