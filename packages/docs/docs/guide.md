Checkout Engine takes a more modern approach to checkout. It's allows for much more dynamic switching of products in a checkout form, in real-time. This lets a user shop directly on the checkout form, and modify their purchase with the click of a few buttons.

In order to define and modify different products that can occur in a checkout form, we've provided some powerful web components to allow for these types of actions with little effort.
