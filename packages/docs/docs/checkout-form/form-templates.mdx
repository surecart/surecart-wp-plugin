# Add A Form Template

A form template is a default set of form fields for a particular form. This lets the
user choose between a few types of checkout forms that are "pre-made", that they can edit
and customize, vs creating their own from scratch. The user will be prompted to choose a template
when they create a checkout form.

If you wish to create a form that a user cannot edit, you may want to try creating a <Link to="/docs/checkout-form/creating-static-forms">Static Form</Link> instead.

## Register Your Form Template

You can register your form template using Checkout Engines `surecart_register_form_template` function:

```php
surecart_register_form_template([
	'name' => 'Donation Form',
	'category' => 'Donation',
	'post_type' => 'any',
	'template' => [
		[ "checkout-engine/pricing-section",
			[
				'label' => 'My Label',
				'columns' = 2
			]
		],
		[ "checkout-engine/contact-section" ],
		[ "checkout-engine/payment-section" ],
		[ "checkout-engine/totals-section" ],
		[ "checkout-engine/submit" ]
	]
]);
```
