# Retrieving Models

The PHP models provide a fluent syntax to query the database over the api. In this doc, we will show a variety of ways to retrieve models.

## Retrieving a model by id
The model's all method will retrieve the record with a specific id.

```php
use SureCart\Models\Product;
$product = Product::find('8ba8d60f-5277-4e6b-807c-dee8166446d5');
```

## Retrieving several models.
The model's all method will retrieve the first 10 of the records from the model's associated database table:

```php
use SureCart\Models\Product;

$products = Product::get();
foreach ($products as $product) {
    echo $product->name;
}
```

## Building queries

In order to query by specific parameters, you can use the `where` method. This will send query parameters over the API and return the matching records.

```php
use SureCart\Models\Product;
$archived_products = Product::where([
	'archived' => false
])->get();
```

## Pagination
You can paginate and get subsquent pages of results by using the `paginate` method. This method takes 2 parameters, `page` and `per_page`. The default pagination `per_page` limit is `100`.

```php
use SureCart\Models\Product;

$archived_products = Product::where([
	'archived' => false
])->paginate([
	'per_page' => 20,
	'page' => 2
]);
```

Result:
```php
[
	'object' => 'product',
	'pagination' => [
		'count' => 100,
		'limit' => 20,
		'page' => 2
	],
	'data' => [
		// 20 products
		[
			'id' => '8ba8d60f-5277-4e6b-807c-dee8166446d5',
			...
		]
		...
	]
]
```

## Refreshing Models

If you already have an instance of a model that was retrieved, you can "refresh" the model using the fresh method. The fresh method will re-retrieve the model from the database. The existing model instance will not be affected:

```php
$product = Product::where([
	'ids' => [
		'8ba8d60f-5277-4e6b-807c-dee8166446d5',
		'07fd28e0-e735-4acf-86d8-4d7855055e0b'
	]
])->first();

$freshProduct = $product->fresh();
```

The refresh method will re-hydrate the existing model using fresh data from the database:
```php
$product = Product::create([
	'name' => 'New Product',
]);
$product->name = 'Updated Product';
$product->refresh();
$flight->name; // "New Product"
```
