# Refund Actions Reference

### surecart/refund_succeeded

Occurs when a refund is successful. This can be a partial or full refund. Keep in mind, this is not related
to purchase/access since a partial refund could be processed. If you want to revoke access, please use
the `surecart/purchase_revoked` action instead.

```php
do_action(
	'surecart/refund_succeeded',
	(\SureCart\Models\Refund::class) $refund,
	(array) $webhook_data
)
```
