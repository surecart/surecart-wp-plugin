Occurs when a new order is created. This is typically `draft` status that but can be `paid` or `finalized` as well.

```php
do_action(
	'checkout_engine/order_created',
	(string) $order_id,
	(array) $webhook_data
)
```

### checkout_engine/order_finalized

	(string) $order_id,
	(array) $webhook_data

### checkout_engine/order_made_draft

	(string) $order_id,
	(array) $webhook_data
)
```

### checkout_engine/order_paid

do_action(
	'checkout_engine/order_paid',
	(string) $order_id,
	(array) $webhook_data
)
```
