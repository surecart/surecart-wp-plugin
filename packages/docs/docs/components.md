# Introduction

Presto ships with a library of web components so you can add, extend or modify functionality without needing to code everything from scratch. You can use these components to match UI, ensure accessibility add additional checkout fields, and much more.

## Benefits

Web components have an additional benefit of "Style encapsulation" via [Shadow Dom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM). This prevents other styles on a specific page from inheriting into these components, so they are safe to use no matter what styles exist on the page.

Additional benefits include:

-   👐 Accessible to all via ARIA roles/states/properties and keyboard support.
-   🖥 Designed with both mobile and desktop in mind.
-   👌 Touch input friendly.
-   🎨 Style anything you want with CSS variables. Default light and dark themes are included.
-   🏎️ Performant with lazy loading of components.
-   🧩 Easily build your own components and extend Presto.
-   🗑️ Lightweight
-   💪 Built with TypeScript so you can enjoy completely typed components.
-   🏠 Feel right at home with HTML/CSS/JS thanks to web components.
