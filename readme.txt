**The New Way To Sell On WordPress!**
★★★★★<br>

Tired of overly complex setups, poor performance, too many moving parts, only to get meh results?

Let’s face it, traditional ecommerce plugins for WordPress were all built over 10 years ago. They are old, they are overly complicated, they require expensive add-ons for essential features, and they slow down your website.

They do ecommerce the old way!

Introducing SureCart - A simple yet powerful e-commerce platform designed to grow your business with effortlessly selling online.

## The SureCart Difference ##
SureCart is fundamentally different from other WordPress ecommerce plugins that you may have tried, so it's important to understand the differences.

**Platform Based**
There are two parts to SureCart, the platform, which is the Ecommerce engine, and the plugin.

The platform is built with the same technology that Shopify, Basecamp, GitHub, Twitter, Stripe and more use. These are all multi-billion dollar companies.

The plugin connects to the platform in real-time taking all the load away from your website and onto our platform that was built and optimized for Ecommerce.

This way you get everything you want with none of the stuff you don’t want. SureCart will not slow down your website, it won’t bloat your database, it’s less likely to have plugin conflicts, and it’s made to work with your caching setup. But the real benefit here is you get assurance and peace of mind because you don’t have to worry about security, storage, or backups.

## Who Is SureCart For? ##
SureCart is designed for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes who need a versatile and efficient platform to sell both digital and physical products. It caters to those seeking a reliable solution for managing shipping and fulfillment, enforcing country-specific restrictions, and handling inventory effectively. Additionally, SureCart is ideal for businesses requiring secure file delivery, robust licensing capabilities, and other advanced digital e-commerce functionalities. Whether you're a small startup or a large enterprise, SureCart offers the tools and flexibility needed to streamline your online sales processes.
`
## Now let me tell you what SureCart can do, then why you could consider using it. ##

## SureCart Features ##
These are just some of the features that make SureCart the perfect ecommerce platform for everyone.

* **Multiple Payment Processors, Express Checkout ApplePay & GooglePay:**
Easily connect to Stripe, PayPal, Mollie or PayStack(Premium) to collect payments. You can use multiple processors on a single checkout form. Also you can optionally accept ApplePay or GooglePay express checkout options. We are working on adding additional gateways (RazorPay, Mercado Pago) in the future.

* **Powerful Payment Options:**
One-time payments, subscriptions, subscriptions with free trials, setup fees, payment plans (installments), pay what you want, donations. SureCart covers most ways you may want to be paid, all included for free.

* **Most Complete Subscription Payments System:**
There is a lot more to subscriptions than simply rebilling on an interval. SureCart’s subscription engine is second to none. With our extensive subscription payments options you can sell your subscriptions how you want. But SureCart goes beyond other ecommerce platforms by offering prorated upgrades or downgrades. So if you are offering a monthly subscription or an annual subscription and your buyer wants to upgrade, SureCart can prorate the upgrade.

* **Self Service Customer Area (Subscription Upgrades / Downgrades):**
With our highly customizable customer area, you can have full control on what a customer sees and is able to do. For example, you can let your customers change their personal details, password, access secure digital downloads, update credit cards on file, upgrade a subscription, downgrade a subscription. All with a beautiful and modern user experience.

* **Customizable Shopping Experience:**
Customize product pages, shop pages, cart, and customer dashboard using a intuitive and powerful drag and drop editor that utilitzes the WordPress block editor.

* **Flexible Checkout Form Builder:**
Create a completely custom checkout form. In fact, create as many as you like. There is no other ecommerce platform with this much customizability. Simply drag and drop fields, price choosers, donation choosers, check boxes, and other parts to create the perfect checkout form.

* **Coupon Discounts:**
Incentivizing buyers with a coupon discount is a great way to increase sales. You can easily create unlimited coupons as well as automatically add coupons with a URL parameter.

* **Secure digital file delivery:**
Selling digital downloads? This could be software, printables, ebooks, you name it and SureCart can deliver it securely to your buyers.

* **Slide-out Cart:**
If you want to sell your products or services using a traditional cart allowing buyers to add items then checkout, you will love SureCart’s beautiful and lightning fast slide-out cart.

* **Complete EU Compliance:**
If you are an EU based merchant, you know there are very strict requirements regarding VAT, how you display the prices inclusive of VAT, what information is on invoices, how invoices need to be numbered, etc. SureCart has you covered.

* **Integrate Or Automate:**
The most important part of an ecommerce platform is how it integrates with other plugins and external platforms. SureCart offers integrations with many WordPress plugins, so you can use SureCart for all of your ecommerce.

* **Seamless Scaling:**
With other ecommerce plugins, if you get an influx of buyers for that big sale or promotion, unless you have high powered and high cost hosting, your website will be slow or worse, it will crash. Since SureCart is platform based, when you get an influx of new buyers, you have nothing to worry about because we take care of the scaling for you.

* **Real-time VAT & Sales Tax Calculations:**
Other ecommerce platforms let you integrate with expensive tax calculation services, usually costing $50 per month and up. Not with SureCart, we are fully integrated with TaxJar and we pay for the calculations so you don’t have to. And the setup is a breeze.

SureCart is the Ecommerce platform of your dreams. It delivers a complete Ecommerce experience with everything needed for modern commerce online.

## What Is Unique About SureCart? ##
SureCart was made to give WordPress users a better option for taking payments. Currently most merchants use WooCommerce, which was made over 10 years ago for building big commerce stores like Amazon, Walmart, etc.

SureCart takes a different approach entirely. Made from the ground up to be ultra-high performance, look visually stunning, and be so easy to use that the most non-techie user will have no problem.

With our visual payment form builder, taking payments is as simple as drag and drop.

Sure there are form plugins that can take payments, but they were not made for payments and you can tell the minute you try to use it for that purpose, you better call your developer and designer :-).

SureCart also solves all the technician challenges that you run into with other options. Other options have performance problems or caching issues or something, it’s always something. Not with SureCart, we do all the heavy lifting on our servers to guarantee you a smooth operation, headache free, developer free.

## Our why in one word: CARE ##
* **Connected:** Our platform must connect to everything inside of WordPress and outside

* **Accessible:** Everyone should be welcome to use our platform. It must be accessible to everyone. We want to level the playing field.

* **Reliable:** You should feel SURE that everything is going to work.

* **Easy:** Anyone should be able to start taking payment in under 10 minutes. It must be an elegant experience requiring no code.
